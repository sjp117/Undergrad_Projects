### Mixed Effect Model and Diary Study
- This 'directed studies' project was done to become more fluent in R programming by testing my post-hoc hypotheses on a diary data set used to investigate how differently people internalize a events when writing a dirary in a self-immeresed (first-person) or self-distanced (third-person perspective).
- It contains a supplamentery document that guides through my analysis and visualization process.
